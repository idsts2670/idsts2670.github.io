Of course, everybody loves watching movies and tv shows, and so as I! I wanted to visualize how Netflix has changed over the years. I have utilized the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows">Kaggle</a> to create a dashboard to visualize the Netflix content data. The dashboard is created by Tableau. The dashboard is interactive and you can filter the data by different attributes. The dashboard is also published on Tableau Public. You can see the dashboard by clicking the link below.
