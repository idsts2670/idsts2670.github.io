I have studied abroad in Seattle as an exchange student in 2018-2019. I love the city and the people there. Because my family is involved in real estate, I am interested in the real estate market. I have collected the data of the house sales in King County, Washington, and created a dashboard to visualize the data. The dashboard is created by Tableau. The dashboard is interactive and you can filter the data by different attributes. The dashboard is also published on Tableau Public. You can see the dashboard by clicking the link below.

    The dashboard is very interactive. You can filter the data by different attributes.
    The data is stored in a csv file. The data is collected from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction">Kaggle [House Sales in King County, USA]</a>.
