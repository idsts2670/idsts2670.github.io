Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say itâ€™s a myth based on dodgy science. We are turning some of the data over to you so you can form your own view.
I have studied the climate change data with Time Series techiniques called Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. The data is collected from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data">Kaggle [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data]</a>. The data is stored in a csv file. The data is visualized and analyzed with Python. The data is cleaned and preprocessed. The SARIMA model is built and the model is used to forecast the future temperature. The model is evaluated with the val data and. The model is also used to predict the temperature of the future years. The results are visualized and analyzed. The code is written in Jupyter Notebook. The code is published on GitHub. You can see the code by clicking the link below.

    The dashboard is very interactive. You can filter the data by different attributes.
